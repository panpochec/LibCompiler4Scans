Script compiling dataset with different informations from Gaussian logfiles - it uses simple Python tools, but was a part of a rather big project of converting, writing and analyzing over 3000 Gaussian semi-structured files.
This script was a part of a bigger project, which will be published as scientific paper. It consisted of creation, conversion and analysis of over 3000 files. 
It uses rather simple Python tools, mainly from pandas and numpy, to read difficult Gaussian logfiles and prepare data for analysis, which was performed by a different script.
When the paper will be published, this readme will be updated with link to the publication. It was also the main reason to create my GaussianMaster Python package - the process of script preparation would be much simpler and elegant, and the code much easier to read. Nevertheless, this one may be ugly, but it got the job done!
